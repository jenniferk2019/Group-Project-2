Project 2: '3rdWheel'

Authors: Jennifer, Danit, and Josh

Concept:

Third Weel is a social application that connects individuals/groups of people to one another. The primary demographic is geared towards people who are new to the city.

Use:

Users can either post or join an event/activity divided by three different categories: Food & Wine, Sports, and Entertainment.

Function: 

To use this app, the user is first directed to the homepage where he/she will either login or create an account by signing up. Registration information will be stored within a MySQL database. User information will be encrypted into a Jaws Database. “Join” and “Post” buttons allow the user to either join an open event/activity, or publicly post an event/activity for others to "tag along."

Pages:

'POST' Page - Directs the user to fill out information regarding their event -- like date, time, location, and additional details -- within a form. Once the user submits the form, the individual will be directed to the 'JOIN' page.

'JOIN' Page - Generates and displays event/activity information. A user wanting to join an event/activity will then have a choice to choose and click on the 'TAG ALONG' button for each post.

Technology:

HTMLl5 | CSS3 | Bootstrap/Popper.js | JavaScript/jQuery | MySQL Workbench/Sequelize | Passport | NPM | Node.js | MVC (Model-View-Controller)
